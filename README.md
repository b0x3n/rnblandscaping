# RnB Landscaping

I built this website for a client a couple of years ago in
Laravel, they're no longer in business so am posting the
code here.

This is a full stack app - I gave them an admin area where
they could log in and create and edit projects.

Projects were presented as slideshows that sort of told
a story - flowing from before images, to in progress images
and ending with pictures of the final result.

Since the site is offline and they've moved on I've decided
to post it here, it's not great code but I was just learning
Laravel at the time and it was a fun project to work on.
